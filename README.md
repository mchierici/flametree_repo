# Flametree Gallery

Repo for practicing with forks and pull requests (Physalia course on Git for Reproducible Research).

1. Fork this repo using the “Fork” button on the top right corner. Now, you have a copy of the repo in your GitHub account.
2. Copy the URL of your forked repo, then create a new RStudio project with version control and use the copied URL to clone the repo to your computer, as a RStudio project.
3. Make a copy of the `template_script.R` file and change it to `<your name>.R`
4. Change the name, seed, and shades variables. Run the code if you want!
5. Save it, add it to the staging area, and commit it. Only the new file! 
6. Push the file to your remote repository.
7. Go to your GitHub to start a pull request
