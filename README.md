Repo for practicing with forks and pull requests (Physalia course on Git for Reproducible Research).

1. Fork this repo using the “Fork” button on the top right corner. Now, you have a copy of the repo in your GitHub account.
2. Copy the URL of your forked repo, then create a new RStudio project with version control and use the copied URL to clone the repo to your computer, as a RStudio project.
3. Make a *copy* of the `template_script.R` file and change its name to `<your name>.R`
4. In the new script, change the assignments to the variables `name` (your name), `seed` (there are some random things happening there), and `shades` (choose 4 colors that you like). Run the code!
5. Save the script, add it to the staging area, and commit it. Only the new files! 
6. Push the file to your remote repository.
7. Go to your GitHub to start a pull request.
