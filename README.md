# Flametree Gallery

Repo for practicing with forks and pull requests (Physalia course on Git for Reproducible Research).

1. Fork the repo and clone it to your computer.
2. Make a copy of the `template_script.R` file and change it to `<your name>.R`
3. Change the name, seed, and shades variables. Run the code if you want!
4. Save it, add it to the staging area, and commit it. Only the new file! 
5. Push the file to your remote repository.
6. Go to your GitHub to start a pull request
